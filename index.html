        <h1>New to Photography?</h1>
    </header>
    <main id='main'>
        <p>Start with what you have! Thanks to smartphones cameras and their rapidly increasing quality, millions of us have access to an excellent camera. 
            I became serious about photography while using an iPhone 5 because I had a strong desire 
            to capture the magic of my beloved dog at the beach. I eventually bought a cropped-sensor Sony mirrorless camera and a couple of lenses and 
            took thousands more photos of Skye. He passed away at nearly 17 years old in 2021. Some of those photos 
            I took of him on my first iPhone remain among my favorites of the thousands I took of him. </p>
        <blockquote cite="https://petapixel.com/photography-quotes/">“The camera is an instrument that teaches people how to see without a camera.”
            — Dorothea Lange</blockquote>
        <p>The most important thing I learned shooting on an iPhone was how to compose shots and that sometimes the best shot requires us to squat or kneel on the ground 
            (hello, dog photography!). The quality of your natural lighting and your angle to the light source is the secret ingredient 
            to fabulous shots you'll keep forever. All the following photos were taken on an iPhone:</p>
        <div class="grid-container">
            <div id="img1"><img  class="image-animation" src="images/willow_flats_iphone.jpg" alt="Green vegetation in foreground, water and Teton mountain range in backgroun."></div>
            <div id="caption_tip1"><p>Tip: For landscape photos using a phone, tap the screen to focus on the far scenery so the whole image is in focus.</p></div>
            <div id="img2"><img src="images/longs_portrait_iphone.JPG" alt="Winter scene in Rocky Mountain National Park."></div>
            <div id="caption_tip2"><p>Tip: Be conscious of where you place the sun in your composition.</p></div>
            <div id="img3"><img  src="images/katie_teton_iphone.jpg" alt="Pathway with woman at end overlooking scene of Teton mountains, Jackson Lake."></div>
            <div id="caption_tip3"><p>Tip: When you have leading lines, such as the railings, try different compositions to maintain the visual balance.</p></div>
            <div id="img4"><img src="images/mama_tetons_iphone.jpg" alt="Woman sitting on fence, looking at mountains."></div>
            <div id="caption_tip4"><p>Tip: Keep the rule of thirds in mind when composing shots.</p></div>
            <div id="img5"><img src="images/skye_running_iphone.jpg" alt="White dog running along water's edge after a toy."></div>
            <div id="caption_tip5"><p>Tip: When the subject is in motion, compose the shot so there is more room ahead of the subject than behind them.</p></div>
            <div id="img6"><img src="images/skye_beach_iphone.jpg" alt="White dog trotting along beach."></div>
            <div id="caption_tip6"><p>Tip: Always make sure the horizon is straight or edit them to be straight afterward.</p></div>
            <div id="img7"><img src="images/skye_dripping_iphone.jpg" alt="White and black dog staring at camera, smiling, dripping with water."></div>
            <div id="caption_tip7"><p>Tip: White subjects can easily be overexposed and that is sometimes impossible to correct afterward so focus your exposure on your subject.</p></div>
            <div id="img8"><img src="images/skye_beach_shadow_iphone.jpg" alt="White dog on beach." ></div>
            <div id="caption_tip8"><p>Tip: Be playful and look for ways to capture the personality of your subject indirectly, such as with shadows.</p></div>
            <div id="img9"><img src="images/grand_canyon_iphone.JPG" alt="Grand Canyon at sunset."></div>
            <div id="caption_tip9"><p>Tip: Tapping the phone on the shadows will increase exposure in that area of the photo.</p></div>

        <h2>Let's start with some definitions</h2>
        <p>No matter what camera you use, understanding some principles of photography can give you more shots you're happy with, 
            and hopefully some you're thrilled with. A good place to start is knowing terms like exposure, composition, and resolution, which 
            are impacted by aperture, shutter speed, ISO, and lens length or zoom. Check out the technical explanations below for 
            a beginner-friendly rundown of these terms to get you started.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Exposure: The amount of light that hits the camera sensor (or film), which is largely controlled by how long the shutter is open and the 
                size of the lens aperture. The visual results of exposure is how light or dark the photo turns out. On an iPhone, this can be adjusted by tapping the screen 
            and then dragging up or down next to the box that appears.</li>
            <li>Shutter: The shutter is a physical part of the camera that covers the sensor and opens and closes when a picture is taken. The speed at 
                which the shutter opens is called shutter speed. Most phone cameras have automatic shutter speeds.</li>
            <li>Aperture: A physical part of a lens that is The diameter of the opening of the aperture is adjustable and is labelled as numbers between 
                0.95 and 22, and written as f/0.95, f/7, f/22, etc. The smaller the number, the bigger the opening of the physical aperture. Smaller numbers/larger openings
                are referred to as "fast" lenses. The size of the aperture results in several visual changes in a photo: the depth of field, exposure (lightness/darkness). 
                Depth of field is what makes the backgrounds on some portrait photos look blurry. The smaller the depth of field, the blurrier the background. Some people like this 
                effect to make the subject stand out from the background. When phone cameras have a portrait mode, they are replicating a small depth of field digitally.</li>
