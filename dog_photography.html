        <p>My own dog was my primary source of photographic inspiration for years. While I have had limited opportunity to 
            photograph other people's dogs, I look forward to doing so more in future. Here are a few photography tips when it comes 
            to photographing dogs.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Strategy: Have your camera settings set and ready to go for each shot and work quickly once you ask for the dog's attention, or 
                whatever your goal is for the shot.</li>
            <li>Exposure and resolution: The best portraits are in natural light, but place the subject in the shade to avoid harsh lighting on 
                facial details.</li>
            <li>Composition: Get down at the level of the dog's face.</li>
            <li>Composition: Compose your shot so the whole body is visible and you do not accidentally leave out parts of the 
                tail, paws, ears, or whisps of hair. These are essential to a good composition, just like cropping a photo 
            of a human so just the feet are excluded feels...awkward.</li>
            <li>Get to know the dog. Let the dog relax and explore the area before you ask for its attention.</li>
            <li>Bring something the dog is interested in (a toy that makes a fun noise, tiny chunks of treats, etc.).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I've worked mostly with my own dog who happened to love training so we'd worked on being happy to sit still, 
            as long as he was paid fairly and frequently, as any model should expect. Asking the owner to stand behind you 
            and get the dog's attention, and getting to know the dog briefly before starting so you have an idea what will motivate them should 
            get you off to a good start. If you're working with your own dog, practice rewarding them for sitting still for longer and longer. Start with whatever interval 
            is easy for them even if that's just 1 second, progress slowly, and reward frequently. Separately, you can also build the different skill of being comfortable looking at the 
            camera. Hold it up, give them a treat. Repeat until they start looking whenever you hold it up and then start adding duration so they'll look for a few seconds before 
            being rewarded. This is a game for them so make it fun and after a week of working on this, you'll have a canine model on your hands.
